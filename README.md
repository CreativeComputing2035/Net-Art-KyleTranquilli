# Net-Art-KyleTranquilli

For this project, I intended to create a game that tests playes knowledge of the hits of 80's pop divas.
Each slide presents players with the lyrics to a song.
The player is then asked whether or not the presented lyrics are correct.
If the player chooses the wrong answer, the texts highlights red.
If the user is correct, a link appears that takes viewers to the next slide.
